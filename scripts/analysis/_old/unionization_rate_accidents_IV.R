# Test first stage for accidents as instrument for unionization

# TAKEAWAY:
# No correlation in rough tests
# Only a small proportion of underground coal mines (6.2%) changed union status during the period examined (1993â€“2010), 
# and those that did change status seem to be highly unrepresentative of the population as a whole (see footnote 19 [of Morantz (2013)])"
# => does not seem fruitful to try to find instrument for unionization
# Instead, 
#   A. exploit variation created by mergers to see how some outcome changes for unionized vs. non-unionized mines
#   B. look at how unionized vs. non-unionized (underground) mines are differentially affected by MINER Act
